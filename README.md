# Final-Project

For my final project, I would like to explore the various emotions that we experience in our everyday lives and convey those emotions through my web drawings. 

First, I am going to explore how manipulation of facial features could express different emotions. I will create original SVG icons for facial features and animate them using CSS transitions to display three different facial expressions for anger, sadness, and happiness. For instance, a typical facial expression for anger would be eyebrows pulled down. Before manipulating the facial features on the web, I will be drawing various facial expressions on a paper and studying how manipulating the position of the eyebrows and the eyes could convey different emotions. 

For the second part of my final project, I will be experimenting with lines, shapes, and colors in the background to elicit the three different emotions. For instance, one idea that I have is using a canvas animation to draw random, bold strokes of lines in the background to elicit the feelings of anger and frustration. On the other hand, I could animate bubbles so that they float around in the background to symbolize tears and elicit feelings of sadness and melancholy.

Hence, my three drawings will relate to each other not only conceptually but also aesthetically. My navigational interface page will display a neutral facial expression, and when users hover on an icon or a button, the facial expression will change. Finally, when users click the icon or the button, it will link to my three different drawings.
